A software code to predict blade icing on images of rotor blades using resource-constrained devices.

## Download and use of the repository:
To download this repository and its submodules use

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/malvela/WindTurbine-EisDetection.git

## Individual files and functionality:
This software involves a couple of .m files for predicting ice on rotor blades:

    - Convert_model.py -> It converts a h5 model to a tensorrt model format
    - Transfer_learning.py -> Training and evaluation of the presented models
